'*FOR THE BEST EXPERIANCE; RUN "sapiREADME.vbs" SO SAPI CAN READ IT FOR YOU x)*

'*RUN "sapiREADME.vbs" and dont do anything until the script ends (notification box will pop up letting you know it ended)*

Yup... all this just for one fake trojan.

No, there is no malicious code in here... i promise (pinky swear) 

This is the perfect prank to pull on your friends if you hate them or if y'all got beef or sum...

Anyways heres how it works:


'INTRO. The programming languages used to code the Sapi-Dot-Joke were Virtual Basic Scripting (.VBS), Batch (.BAT), and Powershell Scripting (.PS1), Windows 10 & x64 is also recommended for top quality. No external software download is needed for the Sapi-Dot-Joke to function,
	all of these scripts were created via Notepad. No admin permission, or privalege escalation is necessary for the Sapi-Dot-Joke to work, including internet. (Although internet is recommended for the best experience.)
	!DISCLAIMER: These scripts contain flashing lights and is not recommended to use on someone whom has Photosensitive Epilipsy!
	You are welcome to edit these raw scripts how ever you like! (There is also a settings folder to tweak the virus and run it how you want.) 
	P.S: READ "QUICK-INSTRUCTIONS.txt" BEFORE USE. 
		
	- ADVENTURE script time after update box clicked: On avg 4:30.28 long -


1. This fake trojan prank is not a real virus, your malware detector may say otherwise... dont worry tho its not. These scripts runs commands that are being executed by simple coding i looked up on the internet (rip my nerd creds)
also there are even scripts that open up secretly, these are stealth scripts, they open up in the background hiding some fishy buisness. B)

	A. To start the script run the "ClickToGenerateShortcuts.bat" script to recieve shortcuts to the fake trojan, you have a choice of 4 scripts, these fake viruses will have the name ADVENTURE in it ending with .vbs.
	one of them has a 5 MIN headstart and you can also edit them. To edit headstart time; right click Adventure.vbs, edit with notepad, and on line 3 where it says "wscript.sleep {numbers}" you can change the amount of time it can sleep before start: 
	1 second = 1000 (ex for a 5 min headstart, the code will be: wscript.sleep 300000)

	B. When you start the script, a msg box will be awaiting, hoping to be clicked by the user himself (and yes i just assumed his gender... suck it up punks.)
	anyways if you've changed your mind and you dont want to run the script, simply click the PANIC BUTTON and all processes will be stopped... seriously... all of em.

	C. If you want the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder to delete after finish, simply run "ActivateAutoRemove.bat" to generate a script that would delete the Sapi-Dot-Joke and all of its contents.
	the script that deletes everything will be called "NUKE.bat". *If you changed your mind... ;)*

2. At the end the script will shut the computer down (nothing to be scared of) after the user logs back in another script will launch, faking a lockout scene and asking the user for a "password"(again nothing to be scared of)
Eventually when the whole password asking sham is done they will be returned to their nice lovely happy dappy desktop land.
Oh... and dont worry, the start up script will delete on its own after finish so it wont start up again (so yea no need to panic... and no the panic button won't work this time)
and yes... the giraffe picture, sorry about that one :P (if you havent ran the script yet well... spoilers:changewallpaper.ps1 changes the wallpaper to a picture of a giraffe) btw if these commands dont work than that sucks, might need to use it on a computer whom has admin rights.

3. Many other scripts are involved including, increasing the volume to max and no way to turn it down, mouse gets stuck in corner, infinite minimize script, and a very loud audio file.
speaking of the loud audio file, or "DELLBEEPSPAM.mp3" IS LOUD AS S***! SO DAMN LOUD THAT IM HOPING THE SPEAKERS WONT BLOW UP, ive also tried making it impossible for the victim to close it and turn it down (poor bastard) i left a quiet version for yall just for safety ;)

4. Going back to the stealth scripts, there are batch files (cmd prompts) that kill processes like "chrome.exe", "explorer.exe" < desktop interface, and other windows to black out the screen
nothing to worry about, it is simply temporarly closing out the programs, they will be re-opened after logon.

5. Theres a part where notepad opens up and words start typing by itself while a voice speaks it out, its pretty funny, these are things to expect, like the webpage scrolling vigurously up and down... tall tail sign that there is a virus!
now, you may have noticed a folder called NotificationBOMB, this folder contains an annoying script which brings up pop-ups endlessly all over the screen, with an ear wrenching audio file of pop-up spamming sounds.
NotificationBOMB can be a mini virus itself ;) And don't worry, there is a kill switch in there... wink wink "PANIC BUTTON.bat".

6. Now incase for whatever reason the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder doesnt open, PartyStarta.bat will come in handy. Its a custom made command line only for the Sapi-Dot-Joke. For this to work all you need to do is place the PartyStarta.bat file 
outside of the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder, then youll be given the choices to run the scripts, change the setings, and it even comes with a command prompt! (Only for nerds who know what theyre doing.)
After you select a script all you need to do is walk away, the file will close on its own and hide itself. And afterwards the virus will start and the buddy you pulled the prank on might not be friends with you afterwards...
but i mean big deal that bastard might of deserved it right??? All of these scripts were tested, works perfectly fine, if you get any errors well... fix them your self >:v

7. Well, i just covered everything you needed to know about this folder, also it is constantly being updated so keep up with the current flow B). Anyways thanks for reading (if you did) and happy pranking!
