sapi.speak "just kidding, it was just a prank bro, scared you didnt i? "

sapi.Speak "Anyways whats up everyone i am sapi and too dai ill be reading this for you, today is your lucky day because youre going to hear my sexy voice read this whole thing, anyways lets get down to buisness, im a real gangsta from da hood, i aint no one to play around with. Whatever forget about me lets read the stupid text. Man oh man there is a lot to read. you know what? i'll just read you the important stuff. You ready? Here i go. Ahem, o m g im so nervous."

sapi.Speak "Yup... all this just for one fake virus, crazy huh? Are you even listening to me? bro im bouta pop yo ass if u aint... whatever anyways no there is no malicious code in this script... i promise, pinky swear, this is the perfect prank to pull on your friends if you hate them or if yall got beef or sum... nah mean? nah sayin? here's how this works."

sapi.speak "One. This fake virus prank is not a real virus, your malware detector may say otherwise... dont worry tho its not. This... ahh hua gagaga, sorry that was a piece of lettuce in my mouth from last nights dinner, uhh" 

sapi.Speak "oh crap where was i? oh right... this script runs commands that are being executed by simple coding i looked up on the internet. wow what a nerd, this nibba had to look it up. loser. Anyways there are even scripts that open up secretly, these are stealth scripts, they open up in the background hiding some fishy buisness. Boy that is some serious shart."

sapi.speak "going down to A, To start the script run the Click To Generate Shortcuts dot bat script to recieve shortcuts to the fake virus, you have a choice of 4 scripts, these fake viruses will have the name ADVENTURE in it ending with .vbs."

sapi.speak "One of them has a 5 MIN headstart, you can also edit it, to edit the headstart time, right click on one of the Adventure files, edit with notepad, and on line 3 where it says w script dot sleep and los numeros, you can change the amount of time it can sleep before start, 1 second = 1000, example for a 5 minute headstart, it will be w script dot sleep 300000"

wshShell.run "Calculator.vbs"
wshShell.run "sapiCalculator.vbs"
sapi.Speak "yo is this even correct? hold on bro let me borrow your calculator for a sec"
sapi.Speak "boy this better be right"
sapi.Speak "are you kidding me? who the hell figured this out? whatever bruh im trippin, anyways back to buisness"
sapi.Speak "going down low to B. oh yea baby get down there. by the way stop staring at the screen like that, fix that weird look on your face its freaking me out, uuhh anyways when you start the script, a message box will be awaiting, hoping to be clicked by the user himself (and yes i just assumed his gender... suck it up punks."
	
sapi.Speak "anyways if you've changed your mind and you too coward to run this script on your computer, or you just dont wanna run the script, simply click the PANIC BUTTON and all processes will be stopped... seriously... all of em. even the sexy voice reading this."

sapi.speak "If you want the FakeVirus folder to delete after finish, simply open Activate Auto Remove dot bat to generate a script that would delete the FakeVirus and all of its contents. the script that deletes everything will be called Nuke dot bat. If you changed your mind. and boy that winky face is making feel funny, shash, ahem uh going down to, number doose"

sapi.speak "At the end the script will shut the computer down, nothing to be scared of. after the user logs back in another script will launch, faking a lockout scene and asking the user for a password, again nothing to be scared of. Eventually when the whole password asking sham is done they will be returned to their nice lovely happy dappy desktop land. oh... and dont worry, the start up script will delete on its own after finish so it wont start up again, so yea no need to panic... and no the panic button won't work this time, boy that made no sense."

sapi.Speak "and yes... the giraffe picture, sorry about that one, if you havent ran the script yet well spoilers, change wallpaper dot ps1 changes the wallpaper to a picture of a girraffe, btw if these commands dont work than that sucks, might need to use it on a computer whom has admin rights..."

sapi.Speak "bending over to 3, Many other scripts are involved including, increasing the volume to max and no way to turn it down, wow thats cool, better not be watching porn when that happens. other scripts make the mouse gets stuck in corner, an infinite minimize script, and a very loud audio file. speaking of the loud audio file, or DELLBEEPSPAM1 dot mp3, is LOUD AS bleep, SO DAMN LOUD THAT IM HOPING THE SPEAKERS WONT BLOW UP, ive also tried making it impossible for the victoom to close it and turn it down, poor bastard. i left a quiet version for yall just for safety, winky face"

sapi.Speak "numero cuarto, man im getting good at this spanish boy, cant wait to talk to the la tinas. Going back to the stealth scripts there are batch files, cmd promts, that kill processes like, chrome.exe, explorer.exe, thats the desktop interface so everything will go blank, and other windows to black out the screen, nothing to worry about, it is simply temporarly closing out the programs, they will be re opened after logon"

sapi.Speak "cinco de my yo. Theres a part where notepad opens up and words start typing by itself while i speak it out, yes i am in this virus, pretty cool huh? its really funny, these are things to expect, like the webpage scrolling vigurously up and down... tall tail sign that there is a virus. now, you may have noticed a folder called NotificationBOMB, this folder contains an annoying script which brings up pop-ups endlessly all over the screen, with an ear wrenching audio file of pop-up spamming sounds. NotificationBOMB can be a mini virus itself. And don't worry, there is a kill switch in there... wink wink."

sapi.Speak "Sixy dixy. incase for whatever reason the FakeVirus folder doesnt open, PartyStarta dot bat will come in handy. Its a custom made command line only for the FakeVirus. For this to work all you need to do is place the PartyStarta dot bat file outside of the FakeVirus folder, then youll be given the choices to run the scripts, change the setings, and it even comes with a command prompt! But beware, its only for the nerds who know what theyre doing. Ahem no lives anyways After you select a script all you need to do is walk away, the file will close on its own and hide itself. And afterwards the virus will start and the buddy you pulled the prank on might not be friends with you afterwards..." 

sapi.Speak "but i mean big deal that bastard might of deserved it right??? All of these scripts were tested, works perfectly fine, if you get any errors well... fix them your self"

sapi.speak "going down to, seven deven on the kevin, boy that was sum serious rhymes, i think im ah become a rapper... ahem anyways i just covered everything like a nudist, yes we just went over everything you needed to know about this dumb folder, also it is constantly being updated so keep up with the current flow, anyways thanks for reading, i mean listening to this, if you did, even if you did give your self a round of a plause for surviving my soothing hot dangerous voice, whatever happy pranking! love you baby daddy, muah muah muah. bye bye"

sapi.Speak "oh wait i almost forgot the last part... it says ps, if you prank your buddies with this fake virus, be sure to record and send it to me, bruh that is so dumb like who the hell do we send it too"
