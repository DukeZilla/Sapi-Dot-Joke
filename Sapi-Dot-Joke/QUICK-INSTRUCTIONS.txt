			      	       'HOW TO OPERATE SAPI-DOT-JOKE 101'


- 1:) 	(HOW TO START): If you're going to insert the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder via USB to another computer there are 
=====	2 ways to set this up:

	i. Using the file called 'PartyStarta.bat' (which is the recommended way...)
	'PartyStarta.bat' is a commandline which makes it quick and easy to set everything up.

	ii. Using 'ClickToGenerateShortcuts.bat' to generate shortcuts to start the fake trojan
	This is another way to start the scripts if for some reason 'PartyStarta!.bat' does not work.

	*BE ADVISED; The Sapi-Dot-Joke program selfdestructs in the end by default, in other words it deletes itself! This is called a 
	nuke script, when activated the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder will become invisible (hiding), and will uncheck the "Show hidden files" 
	option on it's own. Not only that, once self-deleted, it wont even show up in the recycle bin!*


- 2:) 	(WHAT TO USE): "ADVENTURE" scripts are the initiators and have different variations... these can be found in the 
===== 	"Scripts" section in the PartyStarta.bat console. Once it's started, a fake update notification will pop up 
	and the following can happen:

	i.   'ADVENTURE Timed.vbs' The user has the choice to delay the script's initiation under an arbitrary amount of time.
	     The notification box will wait until the victim clicks it, once clicked, the timer starts.
	     In other words... the fake trojan will sleep for an x amount of minutes or hours before starting.
	     The time can be configured in 'PartyStarta.bat' or starting 'ADVENTURE Timed.vbs'

	ii.  'ADVENTURE.vbs' Once started the fake trojan will begin immediately regardless if the notification
	     is clicked or not.

	iii. 'ADVENTURE (In the hall of mountain king edition).vbs' Is a special version of the fake trojan in which 
	     it's programmed to go on beat with the classical music piece "Greig - In the hall of mountain king". 
	     The music must start at the same time when the notification is clicked.
     
   	*TIP: To know when the fake trojan is starting, a calculator will open up on screen or in the taskbar ;)*


- 3:) 	(SETTINGS): You can make changes to the Sapi-Dot-Joke scripts in the settings folder, where there are many options / scripts to
=====	enable or disable. This can also be accessed in 'PartyStarta.bat'.

	For ex: By default, the Sapi-Dot-Joke program self-deletes in the end, If you don't want the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder and contents to 
	delete after it's finished, go to the settings folder and double-click 'DeactivateNuke.bat' to deactivate the nuke script. 
	(When enabled & started, the script won't delete or auto hide the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder from desktop)

	*More info can be found in the settings folder under 'SettingsDetails.txt'*


ALT:) 	If the computer is preventing the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder from opening then use 'PartyStarta.bat'
	this is a command line that will bypass that problem and will give you the option to start the 
	scripts, tweak the settings... and it even comes with a free cmd! 
	(Be sure that 'PartyStarta.bat' is outside of the Sapi-Dot-Joke folder, and in the same directory.)

ALERT:) DO NOT Delete, Move or Rename anything, including all files, folders, even renaming the title "Sapi-Dot-Joke"
        Doing so may cause errors and scripts will either halt, or malfunction. (This is to the people who don't
	know what they're doing!)
	It's also HIGHLY recommended that you right click the zip file in which you've extracted the Sapi-Dot-Joke from,
	click properties, then click Unblock, that way all files will garauntee to function properly.

	*More information can be found in the README folder, which goes more in depth of how Sapi-Dot-Joke works.*

    	Ps: 'PANIC-BUTTON.bat' stops Sapi-Dot-Joke... in case you change your mind. 

	- Enjoy :)
